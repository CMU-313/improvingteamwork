# Peer feedback Survey 
The following are the questions that students will be asked to answer about their teammates. The survey is take-home, and issued right after the in-class lecture. They are given 5 days to complete the survey, and it is expected to take 20 - 30 minutes to complete.

We utilized a platform called iDecisionGames to conduct the survey. The feedback from each student is anonymous, and a collated report is generated for each student. The report is then shared with the student and their teammates.

You have been working in your teams for approximately half of the semester at this point. This is a good time to take stock of what you see as the key challenges facing your team, as well as what you think your team is doing well that you would like to continue. Keep in mind, the objective in providing your feedback is to enhance team effectiveness, so the feedback you provide should be focused on behaviors critical to the team functioning well.

The data that you provide in this survey will not be shared with your professor in any way that is identifiable. Your professor will only view aggregated data of the entire class with any identifiable information removed. Furthermore, you will not be graded on the contents of the survey beyond receiving a participation point for completing the survey.

The Team Assessment survey has several components. For each team member, you will be asked to provide developmental and positive feedback concerning their performance thus far. In the self-assessment, you will be asked to anticipate what your team members will say about you. You will also be asked your personal evaluations of how well your team is working together.

You will receive a report during your recitation section that aggregates the data from your teammates. Thus, you will receive the feedback that your teammates provided for you, as well as an aggregation of their perceptions of your team, however, you will not see who provided what feedback or any one individual's answers in the survey.
