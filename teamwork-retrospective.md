# Team Retrospective

Below is the team retrospective deliverable that is assigned at the end of the month long first project.

## Process & Team Reflection (30 pts)

After coding is complete, reflect on your experience as a team. Again, we look for honest reflection, which will likely include reflection on failures. **We will not grade whether you predicted the effort correctly, but rather what you have learned**. 

You will see the following groups of questions on Gradescope. We recommend that your team use collaborative text editing tools like Google Docs to draft your answers, then submit your final answers to Gradescope.

1. **Actual Schedule:** Document the actual schedule of your development process into either an organized list or table. You should include all of the tasks that each team member actually performed and the approximate amount of time each took. Your commit history and other documentation should help you with this.

2. **Schedule Deviations:** Reflect on the differences between your planned and actual schedule, and answer the following questions:
    - Which milestones were predicted correctly and what was re-planned? 
    - Was there anything you did not plan for initially or that you had to drop in the end? 
    - What were the reasons for the above changes and could they have been foreseen with better planning?

3. **Development Process:** Reflect on the process (specifically, the steps each team member took to contribute to the codebase) you followed during the project, and answer the following questions: 
    - What was the process you initially planned to follow? What was the process you actually followed?
    - Was the process effective? Why or why not?
    - Did you skip steps or adopt additional techniques during the project? What were they and why did you do so?

4. **Meeting Minutes:** Attach all meeting minutes kept throughout the project, which should include information about the agenda/topics discussed, decisions made, and work assignments.

5. **Team Experience:** Reflect on your experience working as a team. You should discuss as a team on the aspects of communication, scheduling, responsibilities and equitable contributions. Answer the following points by providing at least three actions that your team will take to improve in the future (feel free to have more than one in category and zero in another, they should just add up to three):
      - What should your team **keep doing?** What worked well, and why? 
      - What should your team **start doing?** What didn't work so well, and why? What will you do differently?
      - What should your team **stop doing?** What are some bad habits that your team should avoid in the future and why?

      **Support your claims**  
      You should reference your meeting minutes to support your claims and provide examples. A weakly supported statement would be as follows:
      > â€œWe will communicate better, because miscommunication caused issues" 
      
      You should support your statements with examples from the development experience. For example: 
      > "In the future, we will try to use [such-and-such a process] for clearly documenting and communicating such design decisions, rather than [the process we did follow/failed to follow]. One of our [main challenges/development slowdown/quality problems] was the integration of components A and B, because the API for A was not well-understood by the developer of B. "

6. **Teamwork Contract:** Based on the process and team reflection above, update your teamwork contract. Did you encounter any issues or unexpected experiences that your original contract did not foresee? Feel free to add in any other clauses if necessary to your team contract. Upload your new teamwork contract (be sure to sign and date it), and **highlight the changes you made in yellow.**

Being able to communicate effectively is an important software engineering skill. As such, your reflection should be well-written and easy to read. Be sure to leave time after writing for revision and proofreading.

**Reflection Grading**  
One of the main purposes of this project is to encourage in-depth analysis of the reasons for good or bad time estimation, scheduling, and teamwork coordination. Doing poorly in these is not unusual (as numerous reports from real-life projects show).  
We will not evaluate how well (or badly) the project went, but instead how well you understood the reasons **why** the project went as it did, and what lessons you drew from your experience to inform your future work. A good reflection document will include concrete statements about lessons learned, with clear supporting evidence, such as examples, to support the claims.
